# The Garden Cycle: A Year in Nature

A garden follows a beautiful, cyclical pattern throughout the year, with each season bringing its own activities, changes, and rewards. This document explores the continuous cycle of gardening through the seasons.

## Plant Life Cycle in the Garden

Each plant in the garden follows its own growth cycle, from seed to maturity and back to seed production:

## Garden Activities Through the Year

The gardener's work follows the natural rhythm of the seasons:

## The Continuous Cycle

The beauty of gardening lies in its continuous nature. Each year builds upon the last:

- **Seeds saved** from this year's harvest become next year's plants
- **Compost created** from garden waste feeds future soil
- **Lessons learned** improve each season's success
- **Perennial plants** return stronger each year

This cycle connects us to the rhythm of nature and provides sustenance, beauty, and satisfaction throughout the year. The garden is never truly finished‚Äîit's always growing, changing, and beginning anew.
