## Signs Your Plant Needs Water

- **Soil check**: Top 1-2 inches feel dry
- **Leaf droop**: Non-succulent leaves look wilted
- **Weight test**: Pot feels noticeably lighter
- **Moisture meter**: Reads "dry" in top soil layer

## Proper Watering Technique

1. **Water slowly** at soil level, not on leaves
2. **Water thoroughly** until water drains from bottom holes
3. **Empty drainage tray** after 30 minutes
4. **Check soil moisture** before next watering
