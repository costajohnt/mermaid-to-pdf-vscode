## Introduction

YouTube is one of the world's largest video-sharing platforms, serving billions of users globally. This document provides a comprehensive overview of YouTube's architecture, covering the key systems and processes that enable the platform to handle massive scale operations including video upload, processing, storage, delivery, and user interactions.

## High-Level Architecture

YouTube's architecture is built on a distributed, microservices-based approach that can handle billions of requests and petabytes of data.

```

## Video Upload Process

The video upload process involves multiple stages from user upload to final availability on the platform.

```mermaid

    participant U as User
    participant WS as Web Server
    participant US as Upload Service
    participant VS as Validation Service
    participant PS as Processing Service
    participant FS as File Storage
    participant DB as Database
    participant CDN as CDN
    
    U->>WS: Upload video request
    WS->>US: Initialize upload session
    US->>U: Upload URL & session token
    U->>US: Upload video chunks
    US->>VS: Validate file format & size
    VS->>US: Validation result
